#WEEK 1:
  * I felt that dismath will be easy since I already learned some of the basics from high school. 
  * But as soon as I read our syllabus, everything went wrong for me and realized it is not that easy compared to highschool.
  * I really had a great time understanding the first few topics since it made me think logically and analyze.
  * I learned that Propositional logic only answers a declerative statement that can only be answered by true or false only.
  * The different kinds of truth was also discussed and I had an overview of them.
  * On the otherhand, the truth table of the logical connectives was very easy to understand and I enjoyed learning them.
  * This logical connectives have their own unique symbols and I learned how to use them and understand them.
  
#WEEK 2:
  * I first encountered the Logical equivalences which is the laws of the proving.
  * I realized that it was somewhat similar to the algebraic laws.
  * It challenged me to practice proving logical problems.
