#WEEK 1:
  * I felt that dismath will be easy since I already learned some of the basics from high school. 
  * But as soon as I read our syllabus, everything went wrong for me and realized it is not that easy compared to highschool.
  * I really had a great time understanding the first few topics since it made me think logically and analyze.
  * I learned that Propositional logic only answers a declerative statement that can only be answered by true or false only.
  * The different kinds of truth was also discussed and I had an overview of them.
  * On the otherhand, the truth table of the logical connectives was very easy to understand and I enjoyed learning them.
  * This logical connectives have their own unique symbols and I learned how to use them and understand them.
  * I learned how to do the truth table
  
   p   |   q   |   ∧    |   ∨   |   ⊕   |   →   |   ↔
------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------| --------| --------
F   |  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |  T  |  T
F   |  T  |  F  |  T  |  T  |  T  |  F
T   |  F  |  F  |  T  |  T  |  F  |  F
T   |  T  |  T  |  T  |  F  |  T  |  T

#WEEK 2:
  * I first encountered the Logical equivalences which is the laws of the proving.
  * I realized that it was somewhat similar to the algebraic laws.
  * I am happy that I could relate this laws with algebra
  
   - Identity Laws
   - Domination Laws
   - Idempotent Laws
   - Double Negation Laws
   - Commutative Laws
   - Assosciative Laws
   - Distributive Laws
   - De Morgan's Laws
   - Absorption Laws
   - Negation Laws
   
  * And these are their logical equivalences:
   
  | Name  |  Logical Equivalences |
| :-----: |:-------:|
| Identity Laws |  p v F = p |
                | p ∧ T = p |
| Domination Laws | p v T = T |
                  | p ∧ F = F |
| Negation Laws | p v ¬p = T |
                | p ∧ ¬p = F |
| Double Negation | ¬(¬p) = p |
| Idempolent Laws | p v p = p |
                  | p ∧ p = p |
| Commutative Laws | p v q = q v p |
                   | p ∧ q = q ∧ p |
| Associative Laws | (p v q) v r = p v (q v r) |
                   | (p ∧ q) ∧ r = p ∧ (q ∧ r) |
| Distributive Laws | p v (q r) = (p v q)  (p v r) |
                    | p ∧ (q v r ) = (p ∧ q) v (p ∧ r)
| DeMorgan's Laws | ¬(p ∧ q) = ¬p v ¬q |
                  | ¬(p v q) = ¬p ∧ ¬q |
| Absorption Laws | p v (p ∧ q) = p |
                  | p ∧ (p v q) = p |
 
  * These laws are very important that it is the key and must always be considered in proving or evaluating problems and statements.
  * It challenged me to practice proving logical problems.
  * Having the Superman Homework really challenged me to think and able to prove that the argument is valid by using the techniques of       proving taught in class.
  * This is my first encounter to have a lot of variables in one argument which made me think more.
  * As I solve my way out in proving the statement, I found out that the argument is valid and therefore superman does not exist! 
  * We were taught about Existential Quantifiers (∃x, "there exist") and Universial Quantifiers (∀x, "for all") but there are few points that I could not really understand and sometimes got confused in, but I think with further practice I can understand them fully.
  * The definition about Validity and Truth are very different because validity is always dependent on the pattern.
  * Finally, The Rules of Interference was discussed and I had advance studies on these because this was used in the Superman Homework. I think I understand them and just need a little bit of practice just to remember them.
  * These Rules of Inference are:
   - Modus ponens
   - Modus tollens
   - Hypothetical syllogism
   - Disjunctive syllogism
   - Addition
   - Simplification
   - Conjunction
   - Resolution

#WEEK 3:

  * I learned that Zero is not an odd number.
  * And learned the Even and Odd functions.
  * The Even number has a function, **n = 2k** ; where n is the even number in integer form.
  * On the other hand, The Odd number has a function, **n = 2k + 1** ; where n is the odd number in integer form.
  * I also knew that there is a condition that it is always true which is **Tautology**.
  * The term **Fallacy** was also discussed which actually means that it is a common form of invalid or faulty reasoning.
  * The term **Argument** was defined as sequence of statements that end with a conclusion.
  * This week, The Rules of Inference were further more discussed and this is the table of the rules:
 
  | Rules of Inference | | |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:|
| p | (p ∧ (p → q)) → q | Modus Ponens |
| p → q |
| ∴ q |
| ¬q | (¬q ∧ (p → q)) →  p | Modus Tollens |
| p → q |
| ∴ ¬p |
| p → q | ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → (p → r) | Hypothetical Syllogism |
| q → r |
| ∴ p → r |
| p v q | ((p v q) ∧  p) → q | Disjunctive Syllogism |
| ¬p |
| ∴ q |
| p | p → (p v q) | Addition |
| ∴ p v q |
| p ∧ q | (p ∧ q) → p | Simplification |
| ∴ p |
| p | ((p) ∧ (q)) → (p ∧ q) | Conjunction |
| q |
| ∴ p ∧ q |
| p v q | ((p v q) ∧ (¬p v r)) → (q v r) | Resolution |
| ¬p v r |
| ∴ q v r |
  * I find that the topics for Week 3 was difficult to analyze and comprehend compared to the first weeks, but this made me motivate to study harder even though I find it difficult to practice and learn.

#WEEK 4:
  * I learned from the discussion on how to use the rules of inference with the example:
  
  “It is not sunny this afternoon and it is colder than yesterday,” “We will go swimming only if it is sunny,” “If we do not go swimming, then we will take a canoe trip,” and “If we take a canoe trip, then we will be home by sunset”

  That lead to the conclusion “We will be home by sunset.”

  * Not only rules of inference were used in proving this argument or statement, these tools are also used namely; Truth Table, Logical Equivalences, and Quantifiers.
  
  * For me it was difficult at first glance, but whenever you try to analyze more, I could see that there are parts that is key to solving and proving the argument.
  * I learned that the technique is to get each of the statements, so that you could relate it to the rules of inference and deduce it to a better statement, and therefore proving it if the argument is valid or not.
  * As I remember, Direct proof was introduced and I had difficulty in understanding it.

#WEEK 5:

  * This week I also find that this week was so confusing and I had difficulty in understanding the topics.
  * Specifically, The **Method of Proofs**, which consists of:
  * **Direct Proof** 
  * **Contraposition**
  * **Vacuous Proof**
  * **Trivial Proof**
  * **Proof by Contradiction**
  
**Direct proof (p → q)**

    - Assume p is T.
    - Show that q is also T.
  **Contraposition (¬q → ¬p)**
  
    - Assume ¬q is T.
    - Show that ¬p is also T.
  **Vacuous Proof (¬p → (p → q))**
  
    - Show that p is F
    - p → q must be T.
  **Trivial Proof (q → (p → q))**
  
    - Show that q is T
    - p → q is also T
  **Proof by Contradiction**
  
    - Asuume that the premise is not T (¬premise ≡ T)
    - Based on that, show that the premise will end up in a contradiction.

#WEEK 6:

* **Proof by Counterexample** was introduced where in it is a proof that allows us to prove that a argument is not true by providing an example where it does not hold.
* And **Mathematical Induction** was introduced as well where I already encountered it in ENGALG1, but somewhat aleady forgotten.
* 

#WEEK 7:
* There was no Classes during week 7.

#WEEK 8:
* This week was the introduction about Algorithms, which makes me think of programming and lets me remember my programming classes that I took a year ago. 
* It was difficut to remember what I learned about programming last year because I was not good in programming and I have difficulty in thinking the logic behind something that I want to do. 
* I took a lot of practice just to pass my programming subjects last year and I did pass but the downside was I really did not remember most of my programming skills. 
* DISMATH on Week 8 gave me a refresher on how to create algorithms based on the function we would like to have.
* Examples of functions that we discussed was  Linear Search, Binary Search, Bubble Sorts, Insertion Sort, etc.
* I was happy that I watched the video presented about sorting, which was a video about people dancing and sorting themselves.
* With the video, I really understand better about the sorting algorithms.

#WEEK 9:
* It is said that Bubble Sort is the simplest of all the sorting algorithms but it takes a lot of time to sort therefore it is not that efficient.
* Similarly, the insertion sort is also simple but not efficient.
* Greedy Algorith is also known as an algorith which is used to find an efficient way to solve a program.
* 

#WEEK 11:
* There was no Clasess during week 11.

#WEEK 12:
* The topics for this week is my favorite compared to those of the other weeks which are more focused on logical reasoning and on proofs and algorithm. I found those topics quite difficult and hard to understand and comprehend, but I believe that I could manage to learn this things in the long term.
* In this week, We were challenged individually to analyze drawings in a more detailed way. The use of our imagination and spatial thinking skills is important since we need to analyze if a figure is planar or not.
