#WEEK 1:
  * I felt that dismath will be easy since I already learned some of the basics from high school. 
  * But as soon as I read our syllabus, everything went wrong for me and realized it is not that easy compared to highschool.
  * I really had a great time understanding the first few topics since it made me think logically and analyze.
  * I learned that Propositional logic only answers a declerative statement that can only be answered by true or false only.
  * The different kinds of truth was also discussed and I had an overview of them.
  * On the otherhand, the truth table of the logical connectives was very easy to understand and I enjoyed learning them.
  * This logical connectives have their own unique symbols and I learned how to use them and understand them.
  * I learned how to do the truth table
  
   p   |   q   |   ∧    |   ∨   |   ⊕   |   →   |   ↔
------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------| --------| --------
F   |  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |  T  |  T
F   |  T  |  F  |  T  |  T  |  T  |  F
T   |  F  |  F  |  T  |  T  |  F  |  F
T   |  T  |  T  |  T  |  F  |  T  |  T
  
#WEEK 2:
  * I first encountered the Logical equivalences which is the laws of the proving.
  * I realized that it was somewhat similar to the algebraic laws.
  * I am happy that I could relate this laws with algebra
  
   - Identity Laws
   - Domination Laws
   - Idempotent Laws
   - Double Negation Laws
   - Commutative Laws
   - Assosciative Laws
   - Distributive Laws
   - De Morgan's Laws
   - Absorption Laws
   - Negation Laws
  * It challenged me to practice proving logical problems.
  * Having the Superman Homework really challenged me to think and able to prove that the argument is valid by using the techniques of       proving taught in class.
  * This is my first encounter to have a lot of variables in one argument which made me think more.
  * As I solve my way out in proving the statement, I found out that the argument is valid and therefore superman does not exist! 
  * We were taught about Existential Quantifiers (∃x, "there exist") and Universial Quantifiers (∀x, "for all") but there are few points that I could not really understand and sometimes got confused in, but I think with further practice I can understand them fully.
  * The definition about Validity and Truth are very different because validity is always dependent on the pattern.
  * Finally, The Rules of Interference was discussed and I had advance studies on these because this was used in the Superman Homework. I think I understand them and just need a little bit of practice just to remember them.
  * These Rules of Inference are:
   - Modus ponens
   - Modus tollens
   - Hypothetical syllogism
   - Disjunctive syllogism
   - Addition
   - Simplification
   - Conjunction
   - Resolution

#WEEK 3:

  * I learned that Zero is not an odd number.
  * And learned the even and odd functions.
